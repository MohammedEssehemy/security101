## A1:2017 - Injection 

<img src={injectionImage} />

---

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

- The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization 
- User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application 
- Most common types are `SQL`, `NoSQL`

---

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

### Mitigation 💉

- Use a safe API, which avoids the use of the interpreter entirely or provides a parameterized interface 
- Use positive list (allowed values)
- Escape special characters using context aware interpreter
- Reduce dynamic queries
- Code Review
- [SAST](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools) and [DAST](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools)

import brokenAuthenticationImage from "../images/Broken_Authentication.png";

## A2:2017 - Broken Authentication 🔓

<img src={brokenAuthenticationImage} />


---

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

- Authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to take-over other users’ identities temporarily or permanently 
- Uses weak or ineffective credential recovery and forgot-password processes  
- Uses plain text, encrypted, or weakly hashed passwords 
- Has missing or ineffective multi-factor authentication

---

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

### Mitigation 💉

- Implement multi-factor authentication to prevent credential stuffing and brute force attacks
- Change default credentials, particularly for admin users 
- Implement weak-password checks 
- Ensure rate limit and apply exponential backoff
- User sessions or authentication tokens should be invalidated during logout or a period of inactivity

## A3:2017 - Sensitive Data Exposure 🤐

<img width={'80%'} height={'40%'} src={sensitiveDataExposureImage} />

---

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

- Many web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data, such as financial, healthcare, and PII. 
- Personal Identifiable information (PII) data such as health records, creden- tials, personal data, and credit cards
- Data transmitted in clear text? protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, and FTP (in transit)
- Is sensitive data stored in clear text, including backups? (at rest)
- are any user agent (browser) security directives or headers missing?

---

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

## Mitigation 💉

- Classify data processed, stored, or transmitted by an application. 
- Identify which data is sensitive according to privacy laws, regulatory requirements, or business needs
- Don’t store sensitive data unnecessarily
- Ensure up-to-date and strong standard algorithms and key management
- Encrypt all data in transit with secure protocols such as TLS
- Use [HSTS - HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- Disable caching for responses that contain sensitive data

</Header>


## A4:2017 - XML External Entities  

<img src={XXEImage} />


---

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

- Many older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents. 
External entities can be used to disclose internal files using the file URI handler, internal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial of service attacks

- use less complex data formats such as JSON, and avoiding serialization of sensitive data

---

import accessControlImage from '../images/Access_Control.png';

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

## A5:2017 - Broken Access Control

<img src={accessControlImage} />


---

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

### Symptoms

- Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced. (Authorization) 
- Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access other users' accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users’ data, change access rights, etc
- Elevation of privilege. Acting as a user without being logged in, or acting as an admin when logged in as a user
- Access control is only effective if enforced in trusted server-side code or server-less API, where the attacker cannot modify the access control check or metadata

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

<img src={clientSideOnlyValidationImage} />

---


<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

### Mitigation

- Deny by default - Leasr tequired privilege
- Enforce record ownership, rather than accepting that the user can create, read, update, or delete any record
- Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate (e.g. repeated failures)
- JWT tokens should be invalidated on the server after logout


---

import misconfigurationsImage from '../images/Misconfigurations.png';

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

### A6:2017 - Security Misconfiguration

<img src={misconfigurationsImage} />


---


<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

- Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue
- This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured CORS and HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information
- Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack
- A repeatable hardening process that makes it fast and easy to deploy another environment that is properly locked down

import xssImage from '../images/xss.jpg';

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

## A7:2017 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

<img src={xssImage} />


---


<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

- XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping
- XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s browser which can hijack user sessions or redirect the user to malicious sites
- XSS attacks include session stealing, account takeover, MFA bypass, malicious software downloads, key logging, ...

---

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

### XSS types

- DOM XSS (Type 0): The entire tainted data flow from source to sink takes place in the browser. For example, the source could be the URL of the page and the sink is a method call that causes the execution of malicious data (e.g., document.write).
- Stored XSS (Type I): The application or API stores unsanitized user input that is viewed at a later time by another user
- Reflected XSS (Type II): user input is immediately returned by a web application in an error message, search result, or any other response without sanitization.


---


<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

### Mitigation

- Using frameworks that automatically escape XSS by design
- Context-aware escaping of untrusted HTTP request data
- Apply strict [Content-Securit-Policy - CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
- Use automated tools such as WAF (Web Application Firewall)

</Header>

## A8:2017 - Insecure Deserialization

<img width="50%" src={insecureDeserializationImage} />

---


<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

- Insecure deserialization often leads to RCE - remote code execution
- Prototype pollution and application logic modification
- Data tampering attacks

---

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

### Mitigation

- Try not to accept serialized objects from untrusted sources
- Enforcing strict type constraints during deserialization before object creation
- Isolating and running code that deserializes in low privilege
- Logging deserialization exceptions and failures
- Implementing integrity checks on serialized objects

---

import componentsWithKnownVulnsImage from '../images/comp_known_vulns.png';

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

#### A9:2017 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

<img width="60%" src={componentsWithKnownVulnsImage} />

---

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

- Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, run with the same privileges as the application
- Only obtain components from official sources over secure links
- Upgrade periodically and perform automated sanity checks
- Remove unused dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files, and documentation
- Monitor for libraries and components that are unmaintained or do not create security patches for older versions

#### A10:2017 - Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

<img src={logMoitoringImage} />

---

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

## What You Cannot See, You Cannot Fight

---

<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

- Insufficient logging and monitoring, allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, and tamper, extract, or destroy data. 
- Most breach studies show time to detect a breach is over 200 days, typically detected by external parties rather than internal processes or monitoring
- It is the bedrock of nearly every major incident

---


<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

## Mitigation

- Ensure all login, access control failures, and server-side input validation failures can be logged with sufficient user context to identify suspicious or malicious accounts
- Use centralized log management solutions
- Establish effective monitoring and alerting such that suspicious activities are detected and responded to in a timely fashion

</Header>

#### A8:2013 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

<img src={CSRFImage} />

---


<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

- A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim’s browser to send a forged HTTP request, including the victim’s session cookie and any other automatically included authentication information, to a vulnerable web application
- Use X-CSRF token
- Requiring the user to reauthenticate, or prove they are a user (e.g., via a CAPTCHA) can also protect against CSRF

### A10: 2013 – Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards


<img src={unvalidatedRedirectImage} />

---


<Header>
    <CustomHeader />
</Header>

- Web applications frequently redirect and forward users to other pages and websites, and use untrusted data to determine the destination pages. Without proper validation, attackers can redirect victims to phishing or malware sites, or use forwards to access unauthorized pages
- Don’t involve user parameters in calculating the destinatio
- Whitelist allowed domains
